The goal of this project is to identify major customer segments for a UK-based non-store online retail company that specializes in selling unique all-occasion gifts. The provided dataset encompasses all the transactions that took place between 1st December 2010 and 9th December 2011. It is worth noting that a significant portion of the company's customer base consists of wholesalers.

By analyzing this transnational dataset, we aim to gain insights into the customer segments that drive the company's sales and understand their distinct characteristics. This information will enable the company to tailor its marketing and operational strategies to better serve these segments, ultimately leading to improved customer satisfaction and business growth.

To achieve our objective, we will employ various data analysis techniques and segmentation methodologies. Initially, we will explore the dataset to understand its structure, variables, and potential data quality issues. This step is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of our subsequent analysis.

Next, we will focus on feature engineering, which involves transforming raw data into meaningful features that capture relevant information about customer behavior and preferences.Once the feature engineering is complete, we will apply clustering algorithms to segment the customer base.

By leveraging the knowledge gained from this analysis, the company can enhance its customer relationship management (CRM) efforts, optimize resource allocation, and make informed business decisions. Ultimately, this will lead to improved customer satisfaction, increased customer retention, and enhanced profitability.
